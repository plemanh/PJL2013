Abstract:
An American in Paris
is a symphonic tone poem by the American composer George Gershwin,
written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in Paris, it
evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s. It is
one of Gershwin's best-known compositions. Gershwin composed the piece
on commission from the New York Philharmonic. He also did the
orchestration (he did not orchestrate his musicals).
